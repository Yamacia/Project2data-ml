# FYS-STK4155 Project nÂ°2

In this project, we will discuss the use of Neural Networks in both **regression** and **classification** problems.

Each task has been seperated in their own file (with their respective names).

A few files are called **optimize_[...]** and have been used to find the most optimal values of certain parameters (more details in the report)

The FFNN class, as well as the activation, cost and scheduler files have been taken from **Morten Hjorth-Jensen**'s [lectures notes](https://compphysics.github.io/MachineLearning/doc/LectureNotes/_build/html/intro.html). 

The final report can also be found in this repository as **FYS_STK4155_Project_2.pdf**

A huge thanks to our teacher Morten Hjorth-Jensen, as well as all of the teacher assistant of FYS-STK4155 for helping us through this entire project !
